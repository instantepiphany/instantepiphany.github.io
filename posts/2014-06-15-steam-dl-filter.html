<p>About 1 year ago (before I got into software development), I started using steam natively on linux. I got pretty good performance with the proprietary AMD drivers, but I had a problem. I had 15GB of download/upload a month, capped to 56kB/s down and up once that was exceeded. The only thing that made it <em>just</em> tolerable, was that any downloads from the handy aarnet mirror, and specifically telstra/bigponds steam game content servers, were counted as “unmetered” data.</p>
<p>On windows, I had been using a brilliant little app by Nigel Bree called <a href="https://code.google.com/p/steam-limiter/">steam-limiter</a>. For those that haven’t used steam-limiter before, it monitors steam game downloads, and only allows downloads from servers matching a rulset that you specify (or use the included auto-detection). Unfortunately, steam-limiter is windows only. I searched on and off for about 6 months, starting about 7 months ago. In that time, I also started learning my first programming language, haskell.</p>
<p>I was happily surprised (I didn’t expect programming to be as enjoyable as I found it), I enjoyed haskell, while it took me a month or 2 to wrap my head around the basics (whether this is because I am a little dense, or possibly haskell wasn’t a great first choice as it is not as popular as the more common imperitave languages like C/++, Java, and therefore doesn’t have as many books/tutorials I don’t know.), I was happily coding my own programs to solve a variety of needs I had (see <a href="https://github.com/instantepiphany/qsrun">qsrun</a>, <a href="https://github.com/instantepiphany/hwrite">hWrite</a>). I wanted to code steamdlfilter in haskell, but doing it through the FFI would be finnicky at best, and as Nigel Bree suggested when I asked for some pointers, I tried to implement it using Cython. This didn’t work. Not due to cython, but to my general lack of knowledge of differing architectures (the steam client is 32-bit, I was getting errors when trying to compile my cython code into 32-bit C libraries on a 64-bit machine). I decided to remove the “inbetween” step of cython, bite the bullet and just learn C (or at least enough to write the library).</p>
<p>While I have written the library, and it “works”, I don’t know yet whether I have used horrible practices/techniques yet, or whether there are things that could be done a lot better. It is ~100 lines, so surely it is too small to stuff up too badly. Surely.</p>
<p>Anyway, while it doesn’t have a nice fancy installer, (though that is on the to-do list) you can check it out on [github], or just nab the clone url: <code>https://github.com/instantepiphany/steamdlfilter</code></p>
<p>Considering it isn’t that large, here is the current version:</p>
